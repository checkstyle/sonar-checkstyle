<p>Checks that there are no tab characters ('\t') in the source code. Rationale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Developers should not need to configure the tab width of their text editors in order to be able to read source code.</li>
    <li>From the Apache jakarta coding standards: In a distributed development environment, when the commit messages get sent to a mailing list, they are almost impossible to read if you use tabs.</li>
</ul>
