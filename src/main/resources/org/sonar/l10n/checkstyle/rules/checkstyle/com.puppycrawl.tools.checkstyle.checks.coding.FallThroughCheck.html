    Checks for fall through in switch statements Finds locations where a case contains Java code - but lacks a break, return, throw or continue statement.<br>

    The check honors special comments to suppress the warning. By default the texts "fallthru", "fall thru", "fall-thru", "fallthrough", "fall through", "fall-through" "fallsthrough", "falls through", "falls-through" (case sensitive). The comment containing these words must be all on one line, and must be on the last non-empty line before the case triggering the warning or on the same line before the case (ugly, but possible).
