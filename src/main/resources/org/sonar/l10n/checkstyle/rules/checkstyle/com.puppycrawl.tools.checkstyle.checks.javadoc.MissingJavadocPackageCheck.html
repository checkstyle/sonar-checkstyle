<p>
    Checks for missing Javadoc comments in package-info.java files.
    <br>
    Rationale: description and other related documentation for a package can be written up in the package-info.java file
    and it gets used in the production of the Javadocs. See <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#packagecomment">link</a> for
    more info.
