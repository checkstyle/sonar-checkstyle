Checks that package names conform to the specified format. The default value of format
       has been chosen to match the requirements in the Java Language specification and the Sun coding conventions.
       However both underscores and uppercase letters are rather uncommon, so most configurations should probably
       assign value ^[a-z]+(\.[a-z][a-z0-9]*)*$ to format
