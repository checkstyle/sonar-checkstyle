<p>
    Checks that a javadoc block tag appears only at the beginning of a line, ignoring leading asterisks and white space. A block tag is a token that starts with @ symbol and is preceded by a whitespace. This check ignores block tags in comments and inside inline tags {@code } and {@literal }.

    Rationale: according to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/doc-comment-spec.html#block-tags">the specification</a> all javadoc block tags should be placed at the beginning of a line. Tags that are not placed at the beginning are treated as plain text. To recognize intentional tag placement to text area it is better to escape the @ symbol, and all non-escaped tags should be located at the beginning of the line. See NOTE section for details on how to escape.
