Implements Bloch, Effective Java, Item 17 - Use Interfaces only to define types.  According to Bloch, an interface should describe a type. It is therefore inappropriate to define an interface that does not contain any methods but only constants. The Standard class javax.swing.SwingConstants is an example of a class that would be flagged by this check. The check can be configured to also disallow marker interfaces like java.io.Serializable, that do not contain methods or constants at all.
