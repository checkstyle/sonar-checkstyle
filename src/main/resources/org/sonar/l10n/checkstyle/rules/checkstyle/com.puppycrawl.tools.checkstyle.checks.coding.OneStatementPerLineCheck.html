    Checks that there is only one statement per line.<br>
    Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.<br>
    In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon. Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.<br>
    OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements: variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements, assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements, object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements, 'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
