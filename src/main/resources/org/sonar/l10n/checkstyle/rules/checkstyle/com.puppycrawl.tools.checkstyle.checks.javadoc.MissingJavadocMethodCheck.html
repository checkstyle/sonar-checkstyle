Checks for missing Javadoc comments for a method or constructor. The scope to verify is
specified using the Scope class and defaults to Scope.PUBLIC. To verify
another scope, set property scope to a different scope.

    <br><br>Javadoc is not required on a method that is tagged with the @Override annotation.
However under Java 5 it is not possible to mark a method required for an interface (this
was corrected under Java 6). Hence Checkstyle supports using the convention of using
a single @inheritDoc tag instead of all the other tags.
