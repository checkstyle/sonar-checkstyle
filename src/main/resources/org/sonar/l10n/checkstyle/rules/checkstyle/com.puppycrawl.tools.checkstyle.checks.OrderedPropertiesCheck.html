    Detects if keys in properties files are in correct order.
    <br>
    Rationale: Sorted properties make it easy for people to find required properties by name in file. It makes merges
    more easy. While there are no problems at runtime. This check is valuable only on files with string resources where
    order of lines does not matter at all, but this can be improved. E.g.:
    checkstyle/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/messages.properties You may suppress warnings of this
    check for files that have an logical structure like build files or log4j configuration files. See SuppressionFilter.
    &lt;suppress checks="OrderedProperties" files="log4j.properties|ResourceBundle/Bug.*.properties|logging.properties"/&gt;
    <br>
    Known limitation: The key should not contain a newline. The string compare will work, but not the line number
    reporting.
