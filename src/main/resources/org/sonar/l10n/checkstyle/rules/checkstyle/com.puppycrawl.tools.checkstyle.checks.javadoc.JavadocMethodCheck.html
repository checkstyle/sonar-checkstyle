Checks the Javadoc of a method or constructor. By default, does not check for unused throws.
    To allow documented java.lang.RuntimeExceptions that are not declared, set property allowUndeclaredRTE to true.
    The scope to verify is specified using the Scope class and defaults to Scope.PRIVATE.
    To verify another scope, set property scope to a different scope.

    <br><br>Error messages about parameters and type parameters for which no param tags are present can be suppressed by defining property allowMissingParamTags.
    Error messages about exceptions which are declared to be thrown, but for which no throws tag is present can be suppressed by defining property allowMissingThrowsTags.
    Error messages about methods which return non-void but for which no return tag is present can be suppressed by defining property allowMissingReturnTag.

    <br><br>Javadoc is not required on a method that is tagged with the @Override annotation.
    However under Java 5 it is not possible to mark a method required for an interface (this was corrected under Java 6).
    Hence Checkstyle supports using the convention of using a single {@inheritDoc} tag instead of all the other tags.

    <br><br>Note that only inheritable items will allow the {@inheritDoc} tag to be used in place of comments.
    Static methods at all visibilities, private non-static methods and constructors are not inheritable.
