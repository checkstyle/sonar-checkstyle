Checks for restricted tokens beneath other tokens.

WARNING: This is a very powerful and flexible check, but, at the same time, it is low-level and very implementation-dependent because its results depend on the grammar we use to build abstract syntax trees. Thus we recommend using other checks when they provide the desired functionality. Essentially, this check just works on the level of an abstract syntax tree and knows nothing about language structures.
