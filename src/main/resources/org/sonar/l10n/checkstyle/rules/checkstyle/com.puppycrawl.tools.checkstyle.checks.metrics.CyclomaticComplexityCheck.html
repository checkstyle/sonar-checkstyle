Checks cyclomatic complexity of methods against a specified limit. The complexity is measured by the number of if, while, do, for, ?:, catch, switch, case  statements, and operators &amp;&amp; and || (plus one) in the body of a constructor, method, static initializer, or instance initializer. It is a measure of the minimum number of possible paths through the source and therefore the number of required tests. Generally 1-4 is considered good, 5-7 ok, 8-10 consider re-factoring, and 11+ re-factor now !
