    Verifies that both the @Deprecated annotation is present and the @deprecated javadoc tag are present when either one
    is present.

    Both ways of flagging deprecation serve their own purpose. The @Deprecated annotation is used for compilers and
    development tools. The @deprecated javadoc tag is used to document why something is deprecated and what, if any,
    alternatives exist.

    In order to properly mark something as deprecated both forms of deprecation should be present.

    Package deprecation is a exception to the rule of always using the javadoc tag and annotation to deprecate. It is
    not clear if the javadoc tool will support it or not as newer versions keep flip flopping on if it is supported or
    will cause an error. See <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8160601">JDK-8160601</a>. The deprecated
    javadoc tag is currently the only way to say why the package is deprecated and what to use instead. Until this is
    resolved, if you don't want to print violations on package-info,
    you can use a filter to ignore these files until the javadoc tool faithfully supports it.
