Outputs a JavaDoc tag as information. Can be used e.g. with the stylesheets that sort the report by author name. To define the format for a tag, set property tagFormat to a regular expression. This check uses two different severity levels. The normal one is used for reporting when the tag is missing. The additional one (tagSeverity) is used for the level of reporting when the tag exists.
