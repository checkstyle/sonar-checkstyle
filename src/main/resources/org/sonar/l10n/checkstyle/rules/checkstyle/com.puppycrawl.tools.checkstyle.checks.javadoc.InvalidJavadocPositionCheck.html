<p>
    Checks that Javadocs are located at the correct position. As specified at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/doc-comment-spec.html">Documentation Comment Specification for the Standard Doclet</a>, Javadocs are recognized only when placed immediately before module, package, class, interface, constructor, method, or field declarations. Any other position, like in the body of a method, will be ignored by the javadoc tool and is considered invalid by this check.
